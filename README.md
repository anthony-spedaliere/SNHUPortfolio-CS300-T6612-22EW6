What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The main problem was to identify the proper data structure to implement for a fictional university's advising assistance software. After choosing a data structure based on the parameters required by the university and the pseudocode analysis the second part of the assignment was to build the advising assistance software in C++.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
The course broke up the problem into logical steps. Beginning with pseudocode for each data structure, followed by an analysis and finally writing the code. I thought this approach was a good one, so I mainly used this step-by-step approach to solve the problem. Data structures are important to understand because they are the foundation of how to approach problem solving in software design. Based on the problem you encounter you have to be able to determine which data strucutre is the most efficient to solve that problem. Efficiency is often measured with big O notation for both time and space efficiency.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
Since this was an online course I mainly had to overcome roadblocks through my own research. Several times I used the discussion board but I had mixed results using this. I relied heavily on reading documenation and using forums to see how others solved related problems.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
This project has shown me that you can use a variety of data structures and algorithms to solve the same problem. A good software engineer is one who can distinguish which data structure to choose as a solution for a given problem.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
By using common algorithms and data structures known by all software engineers, it provides a frame of reference for myself and others who read my code. This can be enhanced by leaving comments throughout the code that serve as hints for the reader. Years down the road when I look back at my code, having the knowledge that I used a particular data structure in a certain area of my code will enable me to understand much faster what my code is doing. Using common data structures makes the code more maintainable, readable, and adaptable.
